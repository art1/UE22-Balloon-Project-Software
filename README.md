# UE22-Balloon-Project-Software
This repo contains the code for a balloon project at the University Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier (course code UE22). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a balloon project based on Arduino Hardware within the scope of the course UE22. The balloon project will measure and record different atmospheric parameters by using various sensors as, pressure, humidity, temperature. Also, an AHRS and a GPS receiver will be implemented.

Enabling and disabling different components can be done in the "basic.h"
